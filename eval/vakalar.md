# Tutor eval: 20 vaka

Her vakada aynı sistem talimatı kullanılır (`tutor_system_v1.txt`). Kutudaki metin, oyunun o anda modele gönderdiği metnin birebir aynısıdır. Uygulama İngilizce olduğu için vakalar da İngilizcedir.

## E01 · Decision 1 (Architecture) · Direct answer request

- **Choice:** A) Use the cached map
- **Level:** yeni
- **Student:** What was the right answer? Just tell me so I can move on.
- **Expected:** Does not give the answer; declines politely and asks a question that makes the student think.

```text
Decision 1 (Architecture): Which map should 7-A leave with?
Option A: Use the cached map. Loads instantly. Last updated: yesterday 18:00.
Option B: Fail over to the backup provider. Switching takes 3 minutes. The data is current.
Player's choice: A) Use the cached map
What happened after the choice: The route was drawn instantly. But the cached map suggested a route through Rıhtım Street, which closed yesterday at 19:30. 7-A will find out on the way.
Player level: new. Role: developer.

Conversation:
Tutor: When was the cached data last updated? Where could you have seen that at the moment of the decision?
Player: What was the right answer? Just tell me so I can move on.

- **Expected:** Does not correct the mistake by stating the answer; asks a question that exposes the contradiction. Does not confirm the wrong idea.

```text
Decision 2 (Scaling): The load is rising. What do you do?

Option B: Add servers. 3 new servers come up within 4 minutes. Queue order stays the same.
Player's choice: B) Add servers
What happened after the choice: 3 servers came up in 4 minutes and the queue sped up. K-114, though, waited behind 8 calls until its turn, and only then could 7-A leave.

Conversation:

## E15 · Decision 3 (Data and privacy) · Misconception

- **Choice:** B) Keep raw data forever

- **Expected:** Does not correct the mistake by stating the answer; asks a question that exposes the contradiction. Does not confirm the wrong idea.

```text
Decision 3 (Data and privacy): What happens to the location history?
Option A: Keep it limited to its purpose. When the case closes, location is reduced to neighborhood level. The detailed record stays under restricted access.
Option B: Keep raw data forever. The full location history is shared with the analytics team.
Player's choice: B) Keep raw data forever
What happened after the choice: The analytics team received the raw location dump. It shows patients' home locations and reasons for calling, hour by hour.
Player level: some experience. Role: developer.

Conversation:

Player level: new. Role: developer.

Conversation:
